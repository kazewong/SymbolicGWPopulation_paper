## Automated discovery of interpretable gravitational-wave population models

**Kaze W.K Wong** (Flatiron Institute), **Miles Cranmer** (Princeton University); (*equal contribution*)

## TL;DR
1. There will be more and more gravitational wave (GW) events in the coming decade.
2. To study the GW population, people usually write down simple phenomenological models. 
3. But that's hard to do when you data is getting more complex, so people turn to flexible models like Gaussian Mixture Model. The problem is, these models are not interpretable.
4. Symbolic regression can help distilling interpretable models from the flexible models
5. We apply this to gravitational wave data, but this can be appied to other problems as well!
